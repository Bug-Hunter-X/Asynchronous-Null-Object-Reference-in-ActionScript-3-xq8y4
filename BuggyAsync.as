The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of a null object, resulting in a runtime error:

```actionscript
var myObject:MyClass = null;
trace(myObject.someProperty);
```

This is a common error, but the uncommon aspect is that the null value might be subtly introduced due to asynchronous operations or unexpected events.
